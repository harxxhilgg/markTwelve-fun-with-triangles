## Apps

- [isTriangle](https://mark-twelve-fun-with-triangles-ochre.vercel.app/index.html): This app takes three input numbers, each representing the angle of a triangle (in degrees), and checks whether these inputs can form a valid triangle or not.

- [Triangle-Quiz](https://mark-twelve-fun-with-triangles-ochre.vercel.app/quiz.html): This app consists of two questions, both related to triangles. You can select the appropriate answers, and the app will provide you with a score based on your responses.
- [Hypotenuse](https://mark-twelve-fun-with-triangles-ochre.vercel.app/hypotenuse.html): This app takes two input numbers, both representing the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. By providing appropriate inputs, you can calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
- [Area-of-Triangle](https://mark-twelve-fun-with-triangles-ochre.vercel.app/areaOfTriangles.html): This app is designed to calculate the area of a triangle based on two input numbers: the length of the base and the height. By providing the appropriate values for these inputs, you can easily determine the area of the triangle.
